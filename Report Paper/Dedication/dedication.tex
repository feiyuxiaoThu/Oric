% ******************************* Thesis Dedidcation ********************************

\begin{dedication} 
I would like to dedicate this thesis to the respectful physicist and pioneer  Dirac, whose book of Quantum Mechanics led me to the universe of science and more importantly the way we construct the theory of world and how to try to prove it. And I would like to quote a paragraph of his interview\footnote{T. Kuhn, interview with P.A.M. Dirac, 6 May 1963-Tape 62b, Niels Bohr Library, American Institute of Physics, New York.} to abstract what I have understood after all my simulations:
\textit{I owe a lot to my engineering training because it [taught] me to tolerate approximations. Previously to that I thought...one should just concentrate on exact equations all the time. Then I got the idea that in the actual world all our equations are only approximate. We must just tend to greater and greater accuracy. In spite of the equations being approximate, they can be beautiful.}
