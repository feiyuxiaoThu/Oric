In this paper, we use the BTE based MC method to study the heat propagation in two-dimension nano-chips with internal heat source and study the phonon transmission across material interfaces of III-V semi-conductors using the atomistic Green's function method. And we also predict the optimazed structure with maximum(minimum) ITC with Bayesian optimization method based on our AGF simulation work. We are the first to fully and systematically study the phonon interface properties of III-V semi-conductors and the successful attempt to employ the Bayesian optimization method into the design of thermal nanostrutures can be enlightening. Based on the work we have done, it is possible to gain a deep knowledge on the physics and mechanism of phonon in interface which has been a key problem in nanoscale heattransfer.
